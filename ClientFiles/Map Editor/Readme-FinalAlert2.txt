KNOWN ISSUES/BUGS
----------
- If FinalAlert 2: Yuri's Revenge crashes while loading pictures, switch into another color mode 
  by right clicking on your desktop and selecting properties. Select the correct 
  tab and switch to another color mode. Then try again. If it doesn´t work, try a 
  lower resolution. And if even this doesn´t help, check the end of this file that 
  has additional notes.
  Work Around:  First you should try switching to 16 bit color depth and probably a 
  lower resolution. If this doesn´t work, you should make sure that c:\ (or where you 
  have your swap file) has enough free space (300-400 MB are perfect). If this also 
  doesn´t help, you can try to increase your swap file size manually (but please only do 
  this if you are experienced!)

- In Windows true color 32 bit when the user right clicks Iso View it may be corrupted.
  Try different color settings in Windows if any unexpected video behavior is occurring.

- Problems may occur if you have one or more mods installed. If you experience problems,
  please try first to remove these mods.

FAQ
----------
Q: How can I create a zoom trigger?
A: If you want to zoom on a particular place, you must first use the 'move camera 
   and scroll to waypoint' action (#48) and then zoom in.  The zoom rate is controlled 
   by an undocumented keyword which must be placed in the [General] section of RULES.INI 
   or your map file: ZoomInFactor=N    } It works to use Edit->Ini to create a [General] 
   section inside the map file and insert the key.

Q: Can I play the maps online? And use the new unit types online?
A: Yes, the synchronization limit is 180 seconds. You can use the unit types online.

Q: How can I keep the map file small so that I´m able to play with 4 players online?
A: One possibility is to "hide" the preview. Just select the appropiate options when you 
   save the map. Since Patch 1.005 will allow longer synch times, this problem should be
   less of an issue..

Q: Ok I´ve made a multiplayer map. How can I play it?
A: In the Yuri's Revenge map settings dialog, choose "multiplayer maps" and click on 
   your's (usually near the bottom). Note that you cannot load the map in the random 
   map editor.

Q: What is that drag & drop feature? How can I copy units/buildings or move them?
A: Instead of deleting a building and placing it somewhere else, you can simply click 
   with the left mouse button on the building and move your mouse while holding down the
   mouse button. You can now see a line that shows where the building/unit will be placed. 
   If you stop holding down the button, the unit/building will be moved there. If you hold 
   down the shift key also, it will be "copied" there. That means you can  create a big 
   army without having to create every unit yourself. Note: if you move/copy a building 
   and it is to big to be placed at the new position, no warning appears! That means you 
   will probably have problems if you don´t make sure that there is enough space!
